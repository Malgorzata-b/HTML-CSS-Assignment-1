        <p>
          <b>The Bernese Mountain Dog</b> is a large working breed from the
          canton of
          <br />
          Bern in the Swiss Alps and one of the four Sennehund, or Swiss
          Mountain breeds. <br />
          Known for their distinctive tricolor coat of black, white, and
          rust,<br />
          these fluffy, gentle giants
          <i><u>weigh between 70 and 115 pounds.</u></i> They are known for
          their <strong>calm and affectionate temperament</strong>,<br />earning
          them a reputation as devoted family companions. Bernese Mountain Dogs
          are also <b>intelligent</b> and <b>relatively</b> easy to train,
          <br />making them well-suited for active families with children. They
          were first bred to pull carts, <br />herd livestock, and
          <i><u>protect their families from predators</u></i
          >. <br />
          Although they were first brought to the United States in the 1920s for
          farm work, today, <br />this devoted breed serves as a working dog,
          therapy dog, service animal, and companion.
